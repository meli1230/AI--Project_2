# **Pacman Search Algorithms**
This project implements classic **search algorithms** to help Pacman navigate mazes efficiently, find food, and reach target locations optimally.

## **License**
This project is for educational purposes and follows the **Berkeley AI Pacman Project** framework. <br/>
Please note that the project has been solved in teams of 2:
- Melisa Marian's work is marked under `@Author: Melisa Marian`
- Iulia Ana Anca's work is marked under `Iulia Anca`

## **Overview**
The goal of this project is to apply fundamental **AI search algorithms** in a grid-based environment. Pacman must navigate through mazes using different strategies, each with its strengths and limitations.

### **Implemented Algorithms**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as deep as possible before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Expands nodes level by level for shortest-path guarantees.
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS):** Uses a priority queue to find the least-cost path.
- **A* Search (A*):** Enhances UCS with heuristics for faster, optimal solutions.

## **How to Run the Search Agents**
Test different search strategies by running:

- **DFS:**
  ```bash
  python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=dfs
  ```
- **BFS:**
  ```bash
  python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs -z 0.5
  ```
- **UCS:**
  ```bash
  python pacman.py -l mediumDottedMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ucs
  ```
- **A*:**
  ```bash
  python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic
  ```

- Use `-h` for a list of available options:
  ```bash
  python pacman.py -h
  ```
  
- Run the autograder to test the given implementation:
```bash
python autograder.py
```

## **File Structure**
- **`search.py`** – Implements the search algorithms
- **`searchAgent.py`** – Defines search-based agents using implemented algorithms
- **`pacman.py`** – Main game engine
- **`util.py`** – Helper functions for data structures
